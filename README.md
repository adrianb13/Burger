# Burger

Hello, this site is based off Node.js, Express.js, and MySQL with the use of ORMs and Handlebars.  It is deployed on heroku.

It is a single page site where you are able to interact with the "menu."  You are provided a list of burgers to choose from or create your own like your own burger joint.  You have the ability to virtually "devour" a burger by clicking each burger listed.

This page can expanded to go into more options. The basics are there for you to be able to pull info from a MySQL database using a UI that is simple and easy to use for any person with a computer or mobile device.
